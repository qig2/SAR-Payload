# Instructions on the SAR Project (Software side)

## DJI Official Document
All prototypes are provided by DJI. Please firstly refer to [DJI Official Document](https://developer.dji.com/cn/payload-sdk/documentation/introduction/index.html) when there is a problem. 
Please also refer to the [DJI Developer Forum](https://bbs.dji.com/forum-79-1.html?from=developer).

## Required components
1. `CMake` `Python3` on Raspberry Pi
2. `Payload SDK` installation packet
3. `DJI Assistant 2` installation packet for Matrice 300 RTK
4. `Raspberry Pi 4B+` with `Raspberry Pi OS 32-bit`
5. `USB to tty converter`
6. `Skyport Development board`
7. `Skyport V2`
8. `DJI Matrice 300 RTK`

## Connections between components
1. Raspberry Pi -> USB to `tty` converter -> `UART` -> `skyport` development board -> `skyport v2` -> drone
2. Raspberry Pi -> Ethernet Connection -> `skyport` development board -> `skyport v2` -> drone
![](DJI%20Skyport%20Development/IMG_3135.HEIC)

## First time setup
1. Apply for Business account.
2. Download `PSDK`, `DJI Assistant 2 `under developer account.
3. Copy the file to Raspberry Pi (Cautious when using a Mac, may encounter problem with `com.apple.quarantine` problem when `make`, recommend to download in Raspberry Pi).
4. Modify some files according to the websiteâ€™s instructions [Tutorial on modifying the psdk_demo](https://www.freesion.com/article/2294962127/).
5. Follow the DJI Official document for PSDK [DJI PSDK Document](https://developer.dji.com/cn/payload-sdk/documentation/quickstart/run-the-sample.html).
6. Make sure the network port and serial port match with your own configuration. (`ls -l /dev/tty*` and `ls -l /dev/serial*` and `ifconfig`, example serial port `/dev/ttyUSB0` using tty converter, network port `eth0` for ethernet connection)
7. Install `DJI Assistant 2` on your PC, log in your DJI account and connect your drone with PC through the Type-C port on top of the drone.
8. Bind your device on `DJI Assistant 2`.
9. Run the following code on the Raspberry Pi.
```
> cd Pay5/sample/platform/linux/mainfold2/project/build
> cmake.. && make clean && make
> sudo ./SAR_module_adaption
```
10. The `Binding status` of the `DJI Skyport V2` should be `Bound`.

## Possible Errors
1. [PSDK init fail] May not register device on DJI Assistant 2.
2. [Network permission on `./psdk_demo`] Add `sudo` in front.

## Make Project
After modifying any file in the folder, please remake the whole project. 

Before Making the project, please make sure you have the following files in the `build` folder.

- data_subscription_data_in_main.txt
- SAR_start_timestamp.txt
- wKA_fft_1d.py 

Then run the following code in terminal.
```
> cd Pay5/sample/platform/linux/mainfold2/project/build
> cmake.. && make clean && make
> sudo ./SAR_module_adaption
```

## Rough estimation of the start/stop timestamp using python
Please run `find_5_m_s.py`.
